                        The Pug is a breed of dog originally from China, with physically distinctive features of a
                        wrinkly,
                        short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety
                        of
                        colors, most often fawn (light brown) or black, and a compact, square body with well developed
                        and
                        thick muscles all over the body.

                        The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to
                        the
                        taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has
                        evolved
                        over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large,
                        single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their
                        domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE.

                        Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family
                        Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright, triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned
                        snout,
                        and a long bushy tail (or brush).

                    The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within
                    the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses.
                    It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.

                    The alpaca (Lama pacos) is a species of South American camelid mammal. It is similar to, and often
                    confused with, the llama. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals
                    are closely related and can successfully crossbreed.
